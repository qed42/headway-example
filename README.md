# Headway - Selenium Data Driven Framework

Headway is a data-driven testing framework that uses Selenium to automate web-based applications. It is designed to simplify the process of creating and executing automated tests by separating test data from test logic.

********************************************************************************

## Features

1. Data-driven approach: Test data is stored separately from the test scripts, allowing for easy modification and reuse of test cases.
2. Modularity: The framework is built using a modular approach, making it easy to add or remove functionality as needed.
3. Reporting: The framework generates detailed test reports in HTML format, making it easy to track test results and identify issues.
4. Cross-browser compatibility: The framework supports testing on multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
5. Parallel testing: The framework supports parallel execution of test cases, reducing the overall test execution time
